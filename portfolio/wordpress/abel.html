			<p>Abel Construction specialises in general contracting and construction management, design build, IPD and facilities maintenance. We are one of the largest contractors in the Kentuckiana region and have helped build some of the area’s most recognisable landmarks. Our construction experience and expertise is unmatched—but we didn’t earn it over night.</p>
			<p>Today, Abel Construction continues to grow and evolve, while holding fast to those principles first set forth by William Abel all those years ago. They have been defining the construction business for their clients in Kentucky for over seven decades. They have weathered their fair share of economic cycles and their experience, stability and capabilities distinguish us in the market. For them, it’s always about relationships and trust. Ask their clients and you’ll hear no one does construction better. That’s a promise they work hard to back up on every project. That’s the Abel Construction advantage.</p>
