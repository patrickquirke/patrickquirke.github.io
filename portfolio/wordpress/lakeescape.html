			<p>At Lake Escape Yacht Sales, they offer their clients an honest, straight forward approach that ensures both buyers and sellers walk away happy from every sale. They strongly feel that if a transaction’s not good for all parties involved, it ultimately won’t be good for anyone.</p>
			<p>Lynn Grissom, founder of Lake Escape Yacht Sales, started brokering houseboats and cruisers several years ago through another company. He had a passion for boating that quickly showed in sales. Friendships formed with fellow brokers and discussions among them made it clear there was a need for a new company, one that let the broker focus on what they’re good at—selling boats and making buyers and sellers happy customers.</p>
