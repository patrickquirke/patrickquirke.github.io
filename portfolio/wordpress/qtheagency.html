			<p>Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Quantum is more than a full-service advertising agency. They are artists, writers and creative thinkers. Business gurus, technology experts and problem solvers. The best and brightest in the business, working together toward one goal—your message on the minds of everyone that counts. Since 1994, they have turned out award-winning work that not only captures the audience, but delivers measurable, positive results.</p>
			<p>Their office may be in Louisville, but their brains are usually off somewhere in cyberspace. Their web team lives, breathes and sometimes even physically ingests digital media marketing (though they don’t recommend the latter without consulting your doctor). They scour the web for the newest trends, then figure out the best ways to put them to work for their clients. When you mix their comprehensive understanding of digital marketing mechanics with their unique creative vision and capabilities, you get something pretty special. It’s back-end meets front-end in an epic story of internet savvy and design expertise. It’s an ideal combination that leads to sites that not only look great but work great, too.</p>
